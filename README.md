# City_Ornaments_MU_2.0
This is a city ornaments mod.

[Ornamental]City_Ornaments_MU 2.0

THIS MOD IS NOT AN UPDATE TO [Ornamental]City_Ornaments 1.0 !
EVERYTHING FROM [Ornamental]City_Ornaments 1.0 IS ALSO AVAILABLE IN 2.0

If you want to keep old savegames with 1.0 undamaged, you should do the following:
Save the modfolder of [Ornamental]City_Ornaments 1.0 and replace it with the enclosed modfolder [Ornamental] City_Ornaments_MU_1.0.
All objects built with 1.0 remain intact. There are no conflicts between 1.0 and 2.0. 
The building menu of 1.0 is also deactivated.


you can expect :

 - 3 new streets

 - a few street ornaments, each with 2 attractiveness points per object

 - the well known water canal, this time covered, with 2 attraction points each per object

 - the water channel from Embesa in a new look in 2 versions. Natural and concrete.

 - matching gargoyles for the "concreted" water channel

 - the Eiffel Tower... ATTENTION : NOT COMPATIBLE WITH "[Ornamental] World-Fair Items" FROM SPICE IT UP ! THIS MOD MUST BE DISABLED !.but you have to earn it in the world-exhibition.(architecture-exhibition --> magnificent-exhibition --> cultivated architecture).this one has a very big radius for its buff to prevent double-buildings,as good as it is possible.a different coloured variant can be chosen by toggling through it

 - a Mt. Rushmore copy, tailored for the annoholics

 - a waterfall that is worth seeing

 - a cafe at the lake

 - street signs for all possible intersections

 - 15 different small marketplaces that function as such and fit into every niche.

 - the original marketplace is expandable in 2 more levels. 1st level is more suitable for working class areas and 2nd level more for investors. the game does not allow any variation. at every restart the variant is reset to the original, that's why there are more expansion levels.
	(known bugs: not all feedback males appear through the upgrade,at the moment this can only be fixed by copying the upgraded level and setting it again.am looking for a solution)

 - a horse farm

 - 27 different flowerbeds/fields to create beautiful eye-catchers. (admittedly some are similar, but the devil is in the detail ;) )

 - a pedestrian bridge suitable for city use, the upscale version of the one in the dlc.

 - land potted plants, each with 2 attractiveness points per object

 - land benches , each with 2 attraction points per object

 - advertising boards, each with 2 attraction points per object

 - Various flags, each with 2 attraction points per object

 - Decorative plaza floors, each with 2 attraction points per object

 - Various fences and gates, now new and clearly sorted

 - Statues and fountains, each with 2 attraction points per object and new objects based on 1602

 - A City Allerlei , with 2 attraction points per object

 - A graveyard with all the trimmings, each with 2 attraction points per object

 - 2 different fortress walls with passage gates


In a separate building menu you will also find :

 - 25 fenced agricultural and animal fields


In contrast to the 1st version, we have tried to make the building menu clearer and to avoid having to switch through it all the time. however, there are 2-3 objects where this is not the case. personally, I find this reasonable.
furthermore,the menus are now to be found in the worker menu as usual,but they are positioned at the last place in order not to displace necessary menus unnecessarily.also in the culture tab you will find the building menus.only the small market places are to be found directly next to the original market place.
Note : 
	
	the complete mod is also available in the arctic.reason : on several requests this was realised.if you don't want to build it there you don't have to,but the option is there.

	the model of the eifel tower is from https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/architectural/engineering/eiffel-tower-056df590-f97e-4f93-8e11-3f2bd25951da and is used under Creative Commons licence ( https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode ).
	nothing was changed on the model itself. It was only textured.

---------------------------
Changelog - 2.2 NOT REALLY SAVEGAME COMPATIBLE !
---------------------------
	
	- due to changes by UBI,corrections had to be made,which are unfortunately not savegame compatible.a savegame without City_Ornaments_2.0 is compatible at any time.
	- some bugfixes and corrections to the objects
	- many objects got an alternative floor (Shift+G)
	- Eiffel tower: you have to earn it in the world exhibition (miracle of architecture->precious->cultivated architecture->box in the middle). you can find it in the City_Ornaments_2.0 building menu in "statues and fountains".
	- various new ornaments have been integrated
	- fences and canals can now be built seamlessly and some have their own gates.
	- following the example of Spice it UP-Plaza Streets (Taubenangriff), 9 new roads with street function have been created. these behave like real roads, but do not show a range overlay.
	- new content with a focus on "railways" has been added.
	- thanks to Taubenangriff,a method has been added that allows you to build objects inside objects.this gives you more freedom when building.you have to be careful where and how you draw your road,for example,because it can be drawn through the object in that case !
	- a little how-to on how to use the new content : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwETqVwslX0
	- a small presentation on how to work with object in object : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXrw_5tqKTE
	
	
---------------------------
Changelog - 2.3 
---------------------------
	
	- General adaptations to GU 14 and resulting bugfixing
	- minor and major visual adjustments to some objects
	- all plaza tiles now have a matching Hacienda decal that can be changed by Shift+G
	- all original ornaments in the NW, which have a plaza floor, have been moved to this mod and have additionally received with Shift+G changeable, matching Hacienda decal
	- some objects were newly created and adapted for use in the NW (decal)
	- 2 new streets in the Hacienda look were created.finally bridges for the Hacienda
	- In case you want to use another rail/road crossing mod,an assets.xml has been provided in which the adjustments for the rail/road crossing have been removed.it is located directly in the mod folder (assets.xml_no_changing_Street_Rails_Crossing).
	  please rename this file to "assets.xml" ,the original from the path "[Mugge] City_Ornaments_2.0_MU/data/config/main/asset" please save once (backup)or rename and/or replace with the one without rail crossings.and you can use other mods which modify the rail/road crossings.
	  However, the "railway" content from 2.2 will then look a bit strange.
	  
	  
---------------------------
Changelog - 2.4 
---------------------------
	
	- After a disaster release of 2.3 where in some cases the decals were completely swapped,here is the completely rebuilt 2.4.
	  since i couldn't find the bug,i have to assume that this system has a bug that i can't reproduce.that's why i didn't use this system for many things,but added another variant instead (shift+V)
	  
	  
	- everything from CO2 has been removed from the culture tab,and moved to a separate tab,which also shows you the version number.the rest can be found in the worker menu,as always.

	- some objects have been redesigned and adapted for use in the NW.for example the canal with hacienda tile as floor.
	- 2 new roads in the hacienda look were created.with these a bridge construction is possible.
	- In case you want to use another rail/road crossing mod,an assets.xml has been provided in which the adjustments for the rail/road crossing have been removed.it is located directly in the mod folder (assets.xml_no_changing_Street_Rails_Crossing).
	  please rename this file to "assets.xml" ,the original from the path "[Mugge] City_Ornaments_2.0_MU/data/config/main/asset" please save once (backup)or rename and/or replace with the one without rail crossings.and you can use other mods which modify the rail/road crossings.
	  However, the "railway" content from 2.2 will then look a bit strange.
