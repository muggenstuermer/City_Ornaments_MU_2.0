# City_Ornaments_MU_2.0
This is a city ornaments mod.

[Ornamental]City_Ornaments_MU 2.0

THIS MOD IS NOT AN UPDATE TO [Ornamental]City_Ornaments 1.0 !
ALL OF [Ornamental] City_Ornaments 1.0 IS ALSO AVAILABLE IN 2.0


you can expect :

 - 3 new streets

 - a few street ornaments, each with 2 attractiveness points per object

 - the well known water canal, this time covered, with 2 attraction points each per object

 - the water channel from Embesa in a new look in 2 versions. Natural and concrete.

 - matching gargoyles for the "concreted" water channel

 - the Eiffel tower...but you have to earn it in the world exhibition.(architecture exhibition --> magnificent exhibition --> cultivated architecture).this one has a very large radius for its buff to prevent double buildings,as good as it is possible.<-- Note: since GNU 10 the radius no more prevents a double building. a different coloured version can be chosen by switching through the different colours.

 - a Mt. Rushmore copy, tailored for the annoholics

 - a waterfall that is worth seeing

 - a cafe at the lake

 - street signs for all possible intersections

 - 15 different small marketplaces that function as such and fit into every niche.

 - the original marketplace is expandable in 2 more levels. 1st level is more suitable for working class areas and 2nd level more for investors. the game does not allow any variation. at every restart the variant is reset to the original, that's why there are more expansion levels.
	(known bugs: not all feedback males appear through the upgrade,at the moment this can only be fixed by copying the upgraded level and setting it again.am looking for a solution)

 - a horse farm

 - 27 different flowerbeds/fields to create beautiful eye-catchers. (admittedly some are similar, but the devil is in the detail ;) )

 - a pedestrian bridge suitable for city use, the upscale version of the one in the dlc.

 - land potted plants, each with 2 attractiveness points per object

 - land benches , each with 2 attraction points per object

 - advertising boards, each with 2 attraction points per object

 - Various flags, each with 2 attraction points per object

 - Decorative plaza floors, each with 2 attraction points per object

 - Various fences and gates, now new and clearly sorted

 - Statues and fountains, each with 2 attraction points per object and new objects based on 1602

 - A City Allerlei , with 2 attraction points per object

 - A graveyard with all the trimmings, each with 2 attraction points per object

 - 2 different fortress walls with passage gates


In a separate building menu you will also find :

 - 25 fenced agricultural and animal fields


In contrast to the 1st version, we have tried to make the building menu clearer and to avoid having to switch through it all the time. however, there are 2-3 objects where this is not the case. personally, I find this reasonable.
furthermore,the menus are now to be found in the worker menu as usual,but they are positioned at the last place in order not to displace necessary menus unnecessarily.also in the culture tab you will find the building menus.only the small market places are to be found directly next to the original market place.
Note : 
	
	the complete mod is also available in the arctic.reason : on several requests this was realised.if you don't want to build it there you don't have to,but the option is there.

	the model of the eifel tower is from https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/architectural/engineering/eiffel-tower-056df590-f97e-4f93-8e11-3f2bd25951da and is used under Creative Commons licence ( https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode ).
	nothing was changed on the model itself. It was only textured.
